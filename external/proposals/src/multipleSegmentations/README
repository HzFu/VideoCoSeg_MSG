Matlab code for pixel classification using multiple segmentation algorithm
described in 

  D. Hoiem, A.A. Efros, and M. Hebert, "Recovering Surface Layout from 
  an Image", IJCV, Vol. 75, No. 1, October 2007.

This code is intended to be used with the GeometricContext src code, 
which has also been released.  The code is intended to make it easier
to train new classifiers, given images and their pixel labels.

Important functions:
  msTrain.m: Training script
  msTestImage.m: Assign label confidences to an image
  msCreateSuperpixels.m: Create the "imsegs" structure from an image
  msPg2confidenceImages.m: Convert superpixel confidences to pixel confidences
  msLabelMap2Sp.m: Convert pixel labels to superpixel labels
