This code computes the marginals or soft-max of the node variables, given a
factor graph. 

This algorithm works quite well for loopy graphs with very strong 
(near-infinite) potentials, which will typically prevent loopy BP from 
converging.  In my ICCV 2007 paper, I found this method to give good results in
about 10-15 seconds, where I had left the BNT implementation of loopy BP 
running for many hours without convergence.

See the example script for how to set factors, etc.  One note is that factors
are written as probabilities (not potentials), so 
P(x1,x2,x3)= 1/Z prod_i f_i(x1,x2,x3)

Different nodes may have different numbers of states.
