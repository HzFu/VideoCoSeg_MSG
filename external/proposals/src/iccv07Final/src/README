"Recovering Occlusion Boundaries from an Image", ICCV 2007.

Please note that this code is only loosely supported.  
For non-commercial use only, without any warranty or guarantee of 
functionality whatsoever.

To Run in Matlab (only way to run):
1) Set matlab paths to include: 
     all subdirectories of src, data
     lightspeed toolbox (from Tom Minka)
     Berkeley Segmentation Dataset /src/lib/matlab (BSDS from Berkeley)
     Geometric Context src (ijcv2007 version) if possible
2) Load double format RGB image: im
3) [bndinfo, pbim, gconf] = im2boundariesTopLevel(im);
4) Display result:
     displayOcclusionResult(im, bndinfo, [], [], [], 1);
     see iccvWriteContourDepthResults for more examples
   


Notes:
1. This code is only loosely supported.  Please only contact me with questions
   or complaints if you are really serious about using the code and really
   cannot figure it out.
2. Geometric context src code is only available within CMU, due to external 
   licensing.  However, others can download the executable from my web page
   and use the confidence images from that.
3. May need to download or recompile segment program by 
   Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher (this is only used for Geometric Context)
4. Edit im2boundariesTopLevel to fit your needs (e.g., if you 
   already have Pb or geometric context computed, edit to access those)
5. This does not include training code.  I am willing to distribute that
   upon request, but you may get hit with a mess of source code.
